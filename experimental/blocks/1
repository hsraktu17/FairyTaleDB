Hello again, Mayank Rajani here, Founder of Project Dark Horse!
In the previous commit, you can see the file 0 being committed to this repo. In the current commit, you will see an additional file called "0.sha512", which was computed from running the command "sha512 experimental/blocks/0" at the root of this repository.

SHA512 is a "pure mathematical function", which means that if you run the same command on the file, it will give you the same output. Hash functions are extremely important in computer science to prove "data integrity". Imagine you send the file 0 to somebody over a channel where there is potential tampering. How would the other person determine that the data that is received is untampered or not? Simple, they can just compute the hash of the file and see if it matches the hash sent by you. Funnily enough, you might be sending the SHA512 over an untrustworthy channel as well, but the good part is: SHA512 has this property that the output is always of the same length, so it is potentially easier for us to send that over from multiple such channels, such that the other side can determine that they are receiving the same value from multiple channels. The key assumption being that there are so many channels that they will not collude with each other to give the same wrong hash, because even if one of the guys "speaks the truth" on the value of the hash, the "liar channels" are opened up to future questioning as for their trustworthiness.

The contents of the "0.sha512" file is: dacf9e175b1f4f3522ef45eab7fb4d5888239fa975ad3aa3b9d4269bd948ae393f7df3e33ec5a27d48fc09adba444a5d6b2943b5985c0e956f0bf1cce1462a01

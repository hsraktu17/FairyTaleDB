Human beings are inherently untrustworthy people. Most people under pressure or greed would sacrifice their ethics in order to make a quick buck. If we were all "good people", these structures like parliaments, corporates, armies, judiciary would not need to exist.

But unfortunately they do, and that is the nature of the world. Lelouch in the show Code Geass says that competition is what breeds progress in the world. \(SPOILER ALERT: The solution of his brother Schneizel to have an entity that maintains fear of the entire world in order to "preserve the world order" is rejected by him.\) It is the same message that the book 1984 by George Orwell is trying to give out: thought policing is never good! Free speech and liberty always wins, in a long enough time horizon. If you haven't watched Code Geass, please do! It has been 11+ years of me having watched it but I am still in awe that Japan creates such insightful shows for their teenage audiences. I hope creative companies in India focused more on such aspects in children, in order to ignite critical thinking, but nahi... inko ad dikhake product bechne se fursat hi kahan hai. Scarcity mindset is so prevalent in India, I am tired of talking about it. Let alone creatives, even VC funds in India which have a LOT of capital don't have the balls to back bold visions like Project Dark Horse. Too scared, too wimpy, too micro-managey. Such a shame!

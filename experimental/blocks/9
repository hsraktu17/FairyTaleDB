So now I will show you how one can create something called as a "cross-chain bridge":

We already discussed in the last block how file #6 can be retrieved from the external data source, GitHub in this case. Now let's say that we have to provide file #6 data to the participants of the current chain, without them interacting with GitHub directly at all. What can we do?

It's simple: we ask an "agent" to fetch the external data, on-demand. Now this agent could be a human being (may or may not be the participant of this chain), or it could be a computer node which has some indirect link with this chain. Isn't it?

How hard is it to write a python program that fetches the data on this URL: https://github.com/mkrjn99/FairyTaleDB/blob/21567c9cb05e65c4f19015f9e95c8e0a91ec0e81/experimental/blocks/6

Can I not just post that program on this chain within this block? I can, but I am lazy. Subah ke 7 baje hain, code likhne ka mann nahi hai. Bye!

SHA512 of previous block is:
